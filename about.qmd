# Accessing R

Please ensure that you have access to R. This can be a local version on your computer ([Warwick download link](https://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/CRAN/)) or [online](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk). 

If you have a local version, it is also worth downloading an IDE (integrated development envrionment). I personally use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

# Creating a new document

There are many possible files that you can create in R. The simplest is to create an R script. This allows you to write code, run code and produce output. You can also annotate your code through comments by writing `#` and then adding any relevant text. 

Alternatively, you can create an R Markdown file. This combines chunks of R code with normal text. Thus, you can create lovely reports that blend code output (e.g. figures and tables) with analysis. RStudio has created a detailed guide available [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) on how to use an R Markdown file.

# R Studio and R Markdown

The following are two cheatsheets produced by R Studio on using their software. 

(If the files are not loading, there also available on the GitHub under the `Cheatsheets` folder [link](https://github.warwick.ac.uk/u2129292/Warwick-Statistics-Society-R-Course-2024-2025).)
