## Appropriate Use of Large Language Models and Other Generative AI Tools

Large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI tools are increasingly available to students and researchers, and their use in statistical work must be governed by clear principles of academic integrity, transparency, and responsibility. When used appropriately, such tools can support learning and productivity; when misused, they risk undermining understanding, originality, and the credibility of reported results.

### Appropriate Uses of Generative AI Tools

Generative AI tools may be used **as assistive aids**, rather than as substitutes for intellectual work. Appropriate uses include:

1. **Language and Presentation Support**
   AI tools can be used to improve the grammar and readability of text you have already written. This is acceptable, provided the underlying ideas, structure, and arguments come form you.

2. **Clarification of Concepts**
   AI tools are really useful for explaining mathematical concepts, especially for understanding the logic behind trikcy proofs and definitions. Note that this should be used to support, not replace, lecture material and independent understanding.

3. **Code Debugging and Syntax Assistance**
   Generative AI can be used to help identify syntax errors and suggest alternative ways of sovling problem. This probably the best use of AI. The debugging stage of writing code *used* to take the longest amount of time, especially when doing it independently. But now, you can use AI tools to quickly identify issues, and more importantly, learn why they happened in the first place!

In all such cases, the AI tool functions as a **supporting instrument**, similar to a spell-checker, reference book, or programming forum.

### Inappropriate Uses of Generative AI Tools

Certain uses of generative AI are **not appropriate** in academic work:

1. **Generating Substantive Analysis or Results**
   It is not acceptable to use AI tools to generate analyses, interpret results, or draw conclusions that you do not fully understand or cannot independently justify. 

2. **Writing Large Sections of the Report**
   Submitting large portions of AI-generated text as original work, including constitutes academic misconduct if not explicitly permitted and acknowledged. This applies even if the text is edited afterwards. 

3. **Producing Code Without Understanding**
   Using AI to generate entire code blocks without understanding how they work is inappropriate. Statistical programming is part of the assessed intellectual work and thus constitutes to academic dishonesty.

4. **Fabrication of References, Data, or Methods**
   AI tools may produce plausible-sounding but incorrect citations, datasets, or methodological claims. Be very careful when trusting AI outputs and be sure to fact check them!

### Transparency and Responsibility

Students are responsible for **everything submitted under their name**, regardless of whether AI tools were used. Here are some tips to know whether you have used AI well or not:

* All results can be explained and defended orally if required.
* All claims, references, and code outputs are independently verified.
* If you had to do this assignment again with only the knowledge you had now, after using AI, you would not need to consult the AI for a second time.

Ultimately, generative AI tools should be viewed as **assistive technologies**, not as all-knowing assignment printers. Sound statistical reporting depends on human judgement and reasoning, which cannot be delegated to a probabilistic system!
