# Using AI in your work

To start off, I want to make this clear: You should NOT be using AI to do your coursework for you! In no way is this section endorsing the use of LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, or other models to cut corners on assignments and coursework. This section will simply go through the healthy, and *acceptable* ways to use AI in your everyday studies.

## Good Ways to Use AI in Statistics Assignments

```         
Clarifying Concepts

    Use AI to explain statistical ideas (e.g., Bayesian inference, p-values, regression assumptions) in simpler terms.

    Great for quick refreshers before you start writing.

Code Debugging & Optimisation

    Paste your R / Python code and ask AI to find errors or suggest more efficient approaches.

    Useful for spotting typos, missing parentheses, or inefficient loops.

Exploratory Data Analysis Help

    Ask AI for ideas on which plots or summary stats to include.

    Use it to remember ggplot2 or matplotlib syntax you’ve forgotten.

Report Structure Guidance

    Get sample outlines, section names, and suggestions for logical flow.

    Ask for alternative ways to present your results (e.g., tables vs plots).

Finding References & Resources

    Ask for academic sources, journal article suggestions, or textbooks.

    Always check the actual source before citing — AI can suggest leads but you must verify.

Plain-Language Drafting

    Use AI to rephrase technical findings for a non-statistical audience.

    Helpful for the Abstract, Discussion, or Recommendations sections.

## What to Avoid When Using AI

```         
Copy-Pasting AI Output as Your Work

    Risks plagiarism and academic misconduct.

    Even if AI generates correct text/code, rewrite in your own words and verify every number.

Trusting Generated Code Blindly

    AI can produce syntactically correct but statistically wrong methods (e.g., mis-specified models, wrong assumptions).

    Always check the logic and outputs yourself.

Using AI for Fabricated Results

    Never generate fake datasets, fake statistical outputs, or invented references.

    Fabrication can be detected and is a serious offence.

Skipping Understanding

    If you let AI do all the work, you won’t be able to defend your answers if questioned.

    Make sure you can explain every step in your own words.

Overusing AI for Writing

    Avoid making your whole report “AI-polished” to the point it loses your voice.

    Many professors can spot a fully AI-written paper — and it may lack context-specific insight.

Ignoring Data Privacy

    Don’t paste sensitive or unpublished data into AI tools if your university or project has confidentiality requirements.
