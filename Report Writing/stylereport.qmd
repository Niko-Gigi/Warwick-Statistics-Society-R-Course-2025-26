Here are some guidelines.
1. The report must be self-contained: everything should either be stated ex-
plicitly, be justified by a reference to some other source, or be common
knowledge. In particular, the source of any data should be clearly indi-
cated.
2. It is not usually sensible to describe everything that you did in detail.
Indeed, if you modify your approach, there is no need to describe the earlier
approach more than briefly.
5 Presentation
Reports should be attractive and easy to find one’s way through. Hence, they
should be neat, clean and tidy, and must be legible. It is advisable that you try to
word-process the report– not a difficult thing to do on the School of Mathematics
or other University PCs available to you using Word or Latex.
5.1 Figures, Plots, diagrams, etc.
Tables, figures, graphs, and diagrams should be titled and numbered (and prefer-
ably given a caption). Sections (which should have headings) and pages should
5
also be numbered. Headings should stand out (by being underlined or on a sepa-
rate line, for example) and should never appear as the last line of a page. Think
of a report as needing signposts, provided by the section numbers. Similarly,
graphs need to be neatly drawn, carefully labelled and titled: scales should be
chosen sensibly and the units indicated. Freehand graphs, carefully drawn, may
be appropriate; a sketch graph with various amendments, and axes carelessly
drawn, will never be. As far as possible, tables and diagrams should be placed
in the text near to the passage referring to them.
5.2 Tables
Tables need titles, numbering and captions, should be boxed in, and figures in
columns should be aligned correctly, usually so that the decimal points fall in
the same column. Rows and columns usually need labels or headings, and units
must be stated in, or perhaps close to, the table.
5.3 Computer output
Computer output needs some thought. For a student project, it may not be nec-
essary to copy the results from the output so that they have the same appearance
as the rest of the report; it should suffice if the output is edited appropriately
first and then pasted onto the body of the report or otherwise attach it.
A possibly helpful reference is Chapman & Mahon (1986).
6 Use of English
It is very important that you think carefully about your use of English. The ob-
ject of writing, as of speaking, is to communicate. Writing, in particular, requires
very careful use of language, especially when abstract and difficult concepts (such
as those involved in statistical modelling and analysis) are to be communicated.
It is easy to read and understand English which is well written and follows the
rules of good usage. However, as the quality of writing deteriorates, it becomes
progressively more difficult for the reader to work out its intended meaning. Fi-
nally it becomes impossible. While many project reports are written to a very
high standard, many others contain much that is unintelligible. An obvious, and
easily corrected, problem occurs when the author fails to use properly constructed
sentences. (A good first test check here is to identify the verb in each sentence!)
A much more insidious (and very frequent) problem occurs when the author un-
consciously assumes that the reader is somehow following his/her quite unwritten
train of thought. Thus the reader is presumed to know exactly what the author is
talking about—for example, what variables are currently being considered, what
is being held fixed, and what is being allowed to vary - when in fact none of this
6
has ever been stated. Attached to this document are some illustrative quotations,
with commentary where appropriate, which have been taken from recent project
reports. In most cases you will find that the sentences look just fine - until you
try to decode the meaning. How should you attempt to improve the quality of
your writing? It is important to understand that, like learning to drive, this is
something you have to work at. No doubt an ability to write well comes more
easily to some than to others, but everyone needs to put some effort into acquir-
ing this skill, and anyone can improve if they do. Of course there are plenty of
books on how to write well, but perhaps the most useful thing you can do is to
read widely (books, articles in quality newspapers, etc ) and learn to observe how
others write.
7 Style
1. Be brief and to the point and use shorter rather than longer words. Thus,
‘schools and colleges’ is to be preferred to ‘educational establishments’ if
the two phrases are used with the same meaning. If you find that you
are writing about something not relevant to your heading then either the
material belongs elsewhere, possibly even to a new separate section, or you
are rambling and the material should be omitted.
2. In general, try to avoid the use of the personal pronoun “I”, as it can get
very irritating to the reader. Impersonal verbs and the passive form are
usually to be preferred, e.g. “A regression analysis was carried out” instead
of “I carried out a regression analysis”.
3. Use of tenses: A scientific report should be written in the present tense
e.g ”The statistical analysis shows that......”, not ”The statistical analysis
showed that.....”. You use the past tense only when describing events that
occurred in the past e.g ”The data were collected in a study conducted by
Royal Statistical Society......”.
4. Try to get your spelling correct! The main problem is knowing which words’
spelling you are shaky on. If in doubt, look up the word in a good dictionary
(Oxford, Cassells, for example) or use a spell-checker.
5. Avoid using words inappropriately. For example, the similar-sounding
words “tendency” and “trend” are not the same and cannot be used in-
terchangeably. Do not use the word “significant” other than in a statistical
sense.
6. If it is not too late, try to write grammatically: whole sentences, each with
its main verb; no telegraphic style. Thus, the following is not acceptable.
7
“A standard analysis is possible. By regression.”
Mathematical/Statistical writing follows the same grammar and syntax as
ordinary English.
7. A common error: the word “data” is treated as if it were a singular noun
instead of as a plural noun, which it is! (Data=plural of the singular noun
datum.) The correct use of the word is “Data are ...”.
8. A good style, which is a pleasure to read, is not something which comes
naturally to mathematicians on the whole. Nevertheless, it is worth trying
to aim for it. The only way to develop a good style is to read good books,
practice writing and read critically what you have written.
Gowers (1973) and Fowler (1983) (see references at the end) are useful books on
grammar, punctuation and style.
