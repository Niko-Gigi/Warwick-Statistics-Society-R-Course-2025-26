There is a lot to learn to create beautiful and informative reports using R. In this section, there are several cheatsheets that will hopefully make this learning curve a little easier. 

(If the files are not loading, there also available on the GitHub under the `Cheatsheets` folder [link](https://github.warwick.ac.uk/u2129292/Warwick-Statistics-Society-R-Course-2024-2025).)

# Latex

Latex is a language that allows for additional control over figures, tables and maths. The following is a cheatsheet created by Winston Chang, with the original version available [here](http://wch.github.io/latexsheet/).

# ggplot2

A very popular package for figures is the `ggplot2` package. It can be installed and loaded with the following code (although it is included in the `tidyverse` package).

```{r}
###| ggplot2 package

#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```
