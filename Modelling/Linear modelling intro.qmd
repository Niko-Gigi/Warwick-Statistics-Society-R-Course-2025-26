This section will begin by introducing a linear model, the key assumptions we must make to fit such a model and model diagnostics. 

Specifically, the pages cover the following:

:::{}
* What is a linear model?
  + Model assumptions, with extra notes on linearity
  + Principle of parsimony
* A continuous data example
  + Using `lm()` and `anova()`
* A categorical data example
  + Intercepts and reference terms
  + Interaction terms
* Check your understanding by fitting various models on the `data.csv` and `coursework.csv` files.
