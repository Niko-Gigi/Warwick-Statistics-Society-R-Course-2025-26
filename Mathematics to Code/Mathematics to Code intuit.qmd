Imagine you’re trying to **explain a puzzle to a robot**. Robots don’t guess or assume, they only understand *exact instructions*. That’s what programming is: **explaining a math idea to a robot** so it can follow it **step by step**. If your instructions are fuzzy, the robot gets confused, just like someone trying to make a cake with missing steps!

## Why Mathematics Makes You a Better Programmer

Mathematics trains you to:


* **Define problems precisely** through rigourous proofs (NOTHING is assumed unless stated)
* **Work with abstract structures** (ideas of groups, rings, fields in algebra)
* **Think algorithmically** (the many algorithms you will come across e.g. Euclidean, Gram-Schmidt)
* **Break complex problems into parts** (this is essentially what you do during a proof!)
* **Understand edge cases and generalization** (this is also a skill gained in proofs!)


::: {.callout-tip title="Math to Code Mindset"}

When approaching a coding task, ask yourself:

* What is the input?
* What transformation is required?
* What is the output?
* Can I represent it mathematically?

Your code is exectued by a machine. Machines do not guess or assume, they only understand *exact* instructions. Therefore, keep in mind to specify your code.
