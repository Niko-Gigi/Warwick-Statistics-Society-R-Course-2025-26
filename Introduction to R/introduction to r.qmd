These pages will cover will introduce some key theory about how R operates and the basic building blocks of coding. It ends with generating plots using inbuilt R commands.  

This section covers: 

:::{}

* how R stores data/values (data types, data structures and variables), 
* how to perform operations (arithmetic, comparison and logical), 
* how to control the structure of your code (if, else, for and while), 
* how to write your own functions, 
* random numbers, and 
* plotting graphs.
